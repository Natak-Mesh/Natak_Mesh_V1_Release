This branch moved mesh creation away from WPA_supplicant. Had issues with encryption establishing on top of the L2 link. The mesh would form quickly, but encryption would be extremely inconsistent. Found if we moved mesh creation to a script and then used wpa_supplicant to only establish encryption it worked well. This branch also has the beginnings of bringing TAKserver onto the node. Startup scripts will start mediaMTX which is required for video streaming.
