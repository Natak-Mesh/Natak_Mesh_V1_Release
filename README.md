Drivers for the rtl8812au are garbage. neither rtw88 or the morrownr or the stock 6.14 mainline drivers seem to be able to handle mesh. wpa3 seems to be broken for these cards also. likely just need to wait for official support. which is a shame becaise these cards look like very powerful dual antenna replacements for the ACHM

moved to kernel 6.14 for the drivers..seems to have broken wpa_supplicant and no mesh mode at all on 2.4 ghz band
can explore going IBSS with nebula for encryption potentially? but right now too much effort. current card is pretty good
